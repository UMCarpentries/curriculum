This is a custom curriculum developed by the University of Michigan 
Carpentries instance. It is in the `alpha` stage of development. 

The curriculum is developed for complete beginners interested in 
learning reproducible data science techniques and integrates instruction 
of R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization; the Unix shell; and 
git and GitHub. For more details, please see 
[Introduction to the Workshop](https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/00-intro/index.html). 

If you are interested in contributing to the curriculum, please read over

and [our contribution guidelines][contributing]. If you would like to set
